# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal was to understand the data, clean it, and explore patterns like survival rate based on age, gender, class, and other features.

## 📌 What’s inside?

In this notebook, I performed the following steps:

- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Checked the structure, missing values, and basic statistics
- Visualized distributions of numeric and categorical columns
- Analyzed survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age
- Detected outliers using boxplots

- Explored correlations between features using a heatmap

## 📊 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and also available through:


## 📷 Sample Visuals

- Heatmap of correlations
- Age distribution by survival
- Countplots for categorical data
- Boxplots to detect outliers

## ✅ Goal

This EDA helped me practice important data analysis skills and understand how different features affect survival chances on the Titanic.
